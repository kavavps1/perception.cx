Hi guys, Apex devs pushed new serverside anti-cheat update.
No need to worry at all. UFOHOOK is still undetected 
but I suggest to not semi-rage (use high smooth, lower RCS/Sway a bit)
Try to use features from the 'Security' tab if you don't feel secure.
Have fun and stay safe!

this message will disappear at the end of the day, ik its annoying xD

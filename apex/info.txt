[time=15]
The free week (+ a few extra days) ends tomorrow, thanks for helping test this cheat
A lot of bugs and issues came up, but I managed to beat most of them after sweating over it all day. 
The codebase is a total monster and putting everything together is honestly painful
Beta guys already have a fully patched build with the final triggerbot/prediction and fixes, they are testing it right now
Tomorrow Ill slowly start disabling licenses and restoring access only for people who bought one before. If I miss you, just open a ticket
